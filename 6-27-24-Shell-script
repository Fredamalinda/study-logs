touch script.sh
chmod +x script.sh
nano script.sh
echo This is my first shell script
touch testfile
ls
echo End of my shell script
./script.sh
Hashs will comment the lines out

if commands
if [ condition ]
then
#statements
fi
nano script.sh
#!/bin/sh
x=10
y=11
if [ $x -ne $y ] 
then
echo "Not equal"
fi

if that is executed with the command
./script.sh
then the output should be
Not equal

If-else statement
In an if-else statement, you can specify a set of commands to run if the condition is not met.
if [ condition ]
then
#set of statements if the condition is true
else
#set of statements if the condition is false
fi

example:
#!/Syntaxbin/sh
x=10
y=10
if [ $x -ne $y ] 
then
echo "Not equal"
else
echo "They are equal"
fi
THen if you excute the command again it will say 
They are equal
