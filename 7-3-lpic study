System architecture
BIOS/UEFI - firmwere systems, both provide a POST
BIOS - Basic Input/Output System
UEFI - Unified Exrensible Firmware Interface
POST - Power-On Self Test, runs basic checks on the BIOS, CPU and memory to make sure they are ready to go before allowing thr boot process to start.
both systems allow user to access the Configuration Utility by pressing delete, F12, or F2 during the startup process.
In the Configuration Utility you can 
  Set the date and time for the hardware clock
  Disable or enable integrated peripherals like built-in LAN and sound devices. Configure error protection, like ECC, Error Correction and Control RAM
  Configure error protection like ECC, Error Correction and Control RAM
  Change hardware settings like IRQs and DMA (IRQs means inturrupts requests and DMA means Direct Memory Access.)
  Choose the order of boot devices
Two ways you can inspect the devices/hardware resources in linux. First, you can use LSPCI or LSUSB
$ sudo lspci       -this will show all of the devices that are connected to the Peripheral Component Interconnect bus 
$ sudo lspci -s 00:03.0 -v    
$ sudo lspci -s 00:03.0 -k    
$ sudo lsusb
$ sudo lsusb -v -d 1781:0c9f
$ sudo lsusb -t
$ sudo lsusb -s 01:20
$ sudo lsmod
$ sudo lsmod | fgrep -i snd
$ sudo modprobe -r snd-hda-intel
$ sudo modinfo snd
$ sudo modinfo -p snd
 /proc
/sys
Special directories that exist in RAM
Used by the kernel to store information on running processes
